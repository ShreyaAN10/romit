“It is just a phrase, it will pass”: A novel approach to generating memorable passphrases

This body of work was undertaken for a course on the seucirty and privacy of end user authentication.

Recent research delves into password strength as passwords persist as the primary authentication method. Balancing security and memorability remains a challenge, with random strings hard to recall and common passwords easy to compromise. Despite the appeal of Password Managers (PMs), they present security and usability issues. This study suggests a unique approach: crafting memorable passphrases for multilingual users, assuming bilingualism or access to romanized non-English words. We analyze the non-randomness of romanized word passphrases, offering user recommendations. A subsequent user study evaluates usability and security perception, offering insights for enhancing proactive password tools and security auditing.
